## Tech Companies I Am Excited To Work For

Technical writing is a branch of content creation and it is one of the many means by which software developers make their income. Writing articles on your personal blog creates a lot of opportunities for you to write documentation for companies in need of documentation (which company doesn't need documentation by the way).

Below are some of the tech companies I am excited to work for and why I would love to work for them.

## Auth0 (Pronounce Auth Zero)
What is Auth0 ? 

Auth0 is a platform that offers authentication and authorization solutions to apps. This means that one wouldn't have to worry about creating one's own authentication and authorization solutions when one is building one's app. Creating a Twitter account requires authentication, the ability to access Twitter's admin dashboard requires authorization, and, ability to log in after creating an account requires authentication. 

### Why I would love to work for Auth0
There are many positive reviews about Auth0's security features with respect to
- API
- Access Controls / Permissions
- Activity Dashboard
- Authentication
- Third-party Integrations
- Two-factor Authentication, 

but most importantly, Auth0's documentations show finess, intelligence, and scrupulous editing on the part of the writers and the editors.

## freeCodeCamp
Almost every developer, especially self-taught developers must have come across freeCodeCamp as the platform where people learn everything about software development in an organized path for FREE. 

Did you know that it emplys a lot of developers as freelance technical writers ? All you need do is submit 3 of your articles to them and pitch yourself. the wonderful thing about writing on freeCodeCamp is that you still own your work.

## Interviewing Clerck Hakathon Runner-up And Aviyel Dev Rel

## Ayodele Samuel Ayodele was one of the Clerck Hakathon Runner-ups. 

Question: 

You are a very popular technical content creator. Two of your projects have been runner ups in Hackathons, with many positive reviews about them, and many developers love to use your Developer Typing Game Platform, to many developers it encourages them to build something brain-tasking like that, but to beginners it can be an intimidating feat. What is your advice to developers who are still trying to get their feet steady in dev world, what was your guide in creating those projects, what was your greatest challenge in build them too ?

Answer: 

thanks a lot Afoma for this questions
firstly, I will like to say I wasn't a pro when I built the developer typing game
in fact it was the first time I worked with Node js and React together in a single project

Question:
Wow ! So what motivated you to create something outside your comfort zone, what kind of resources were more useful to you, and what word of encouragement do you have to give to struggling developers ? 

Answer:

It wasn't easy though, never been easy but I know it is achievable, if Catalin and even my big cousin could do it, I should be able to do it too.
I remember spending 5 days fixing a bug while building the developer typing game, but I didn't quit because.
I realized every tough time in web development is part of the journey and that's why I am always keeping it up.
The same bug occurred in my second project and I was able to fix it in just 2 minutes.
I am not the best developer because of these projects, but they make me feel fulfilled and it's a sign that I am better than my previous self.
I must also mention that I watch a lot of youtube videos that talks about workspace setup and developers achievement, as they help remind me of what is achievable if I keep doing this, and I will keep on surrounding myself with good energies (watching youtube videos of people I want to be like)

Now based on my personal experience as mentioned above, my advice to anyone is that they will never be ready, I wasn't, I don't know 40% of what is needed to build these projects, but once I created their repositories, questioning and google comes very handy, and also they should adopt practicing anything they think they know and build things around it and let their learning process be project-based, as they will encounter several bugs and new things to conquer.

I didn't get better at fixing bugs because I know how to code well, but it's because my regular coding (even if not perfect) has made me get more familiar with error messages and bugs

And finally, they should always ask questions, it saves me lots time, I do ask questions from friends and colleagues whom I taught the basics of JavaScript back then, and that's because they have the answers to what I need and it doesn't make me less of a developer.

My strongest motivation will be the result and goosebumps when someone reaches out about how my content has helped them, I still get messages and emails after 2-3 months after publishing a tutorial.

My advice to struggling developers will be; there is no one way to the market, everyone struggles we just realized what works for us individually, just keep what you do up, you will figure out your way.

The pleasures are mine, the interview also helps me reflect on myself. I appreciate and enjoyed sharing it with you.
